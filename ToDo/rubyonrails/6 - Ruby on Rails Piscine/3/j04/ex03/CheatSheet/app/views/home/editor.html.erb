<p>
  When you write code you will be using a text editor. Of course each text
  editor is different and configurable. Here are just some functions and
  their most general short cuts. All of them work in
  <a href="https://sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>. Your editor may
  differ!
</p>

<p>
  The shortcuts listed here are for Linux/Windows. On a Mac you will have
  to replace <em>Ctrl</em> with <em>Cmd</em>.
