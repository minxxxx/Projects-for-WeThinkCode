text = ["Stick Boy liked Match Girl,
He liked her a lot.
He liked her cute figure,
he thought she was hot.
But could a flame ever burn
for a match and a stick?
It did quite literally;
he burned up quick." ,
"Son, are you happy?
I don't mean to pry,
but do you dream of Heaven?
Have you ever wanted to die?" ,
"My name is Jimmy,
but my friends just call me
the hideous penguin boy." ,
"They took a baseball bat
and whacked open his head.
Mummy Boy fell to the ground;
he finally was dead.
Inside of his head
were no candy or prizes,
just a few stray beetles
of various sizes." ,
"Mr. Smith yelled at the doctor,
What have you done to my boy?
He's not flesh and blood,
he's aluminum alloy!
The doctor said gently,
What I'm going to say
will sound pretty wild.
But you're not the father
of this strange looking child.
You see, there still is some question
about the child's gender,
but we think that its father
is a microwave blender.
My diagnosis, he said
for better or worse,
is that your son is the result
of an old pharaoh's curse." ,
"Voodoo girl
But she knows she has a curse on her,
a curse she cannot win.
For if someone gets too close to her,
the pins stick farther in." ,
"Unwisely, Santa offered a teddy bear to James, unaware
he had been mauled by a grizzly earlier this year." ,
"The Boy with Nails in His Eyes
put up his aluminum tree.
It looked pretty strange
because he couldn't really see." ,
"He can't fly around tall buildings, or outrun a speeding train, the only talent he seems to have is
leaving a nasty stain!" ,
"Alone and rejected, Mummy Boy wept,
then went to the cabinet
where the snack food was kept." ]
